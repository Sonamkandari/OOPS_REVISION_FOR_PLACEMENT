# Encapsulation
- What does this encapsulation mean? Encapsulation refers to building data and function into a single unit. So, what is the best example of encapsulation? The actual capsule of medicine. In that capsule, we can take it as an example of a class, and the capsule is made of different things like methods and functions.
- This example for encapsulation is a class because a class is made up of different variables and methods, and all the variables and methods are encapsulated inside the class.
