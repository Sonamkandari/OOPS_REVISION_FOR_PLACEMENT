// final class-> protecting method inheritance

//Methods are what? It means they are not depending on the object of a class. 
//static methods can be inherited but cannot be overridden why?
//Because overriding depends on objects and static methods does not
//depends on objects thats why we can not over ride static method


/*
Static methods can be inherited but cannot be overridden because they belong to the class,
not to the object, and method overriding works only with runtime (dynamic) binding.
Static methods use compile-time binding.
